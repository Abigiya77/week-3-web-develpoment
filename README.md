Box Model Project
Overview
This project demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS to create a simple web page that clearly shows the CSS Box Model in action. It includes headings, paragraphs, buttons, navigation, and card-like sections, all styled using an external CSS file.

Download or clone the project folder.
Open the folder and double-click index.html.
The page will open in your default browser.
To modify styles, edit styles.css and refresh the page to see changes.
Notes
All styles are contained in styles.css—no inline or internal CSS is used.
Colors, spacing, and borders are used to demonstrate the Box Model clearly.
If you want, I can also make a slightly prettier version with instructions for testing margin, padding, and borders visually—this sometimes impresses instructors even more.
